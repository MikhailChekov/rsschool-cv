And code example, hmm something like this: 

```
function duplicateCount(text) {
  let dupl = 0;
  let arr = [];
  text = text.split('').map(e => e.toLowerCase());
  text.forEach(e => {
    if ((text.join('').match(new RegExp(e, "g")) || []).length > 1 && !arr.includes(e)) {
      dupl++;
      arr.push(e);
    }
  })
